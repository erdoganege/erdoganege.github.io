  <h2 id="unit-testing">What are Unit Tests?<a class="anchor-link" href="#unit-testing" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>
    The first, powerful and most straightforward testing type can be <span style="color:#4db8ff">unit-testing</span>.
    However, I still see some misunderstandings on how to apply them.
    The main idea is to write tests inside your application while targeting small parts. Unit-tests
    live inside your project. <strong>The things that you need be careful:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Unit-tests should focus on specific unit/functionality in your code. i.e. Do not try to test multiple stuff
      in a single unit-test.
        <div class="note-box">
          üëâ Let's say you have an API endpoint called like:
          <pre><code>GET /tools?filter_name=tool1&page=1&page_size=10</code></pre>
          You want to write tests whether this API correctly follow filter_name query to only return tools with given prefix,
          and you also want to be sure that your pagination works fine. Do not write a single unit-test! Just write isolated
          multiple tests where each one of them focus on single functionality.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Do not afraid of writing many unit-tests. You can have duplicate codes to test different functionalities!
        <div class="note-box">
          If we follow the previous example, imagine you wrote down a test for each query which ends up in total of 3 tests.
          You will have a duplicated line where you call this API in each test, but this is totally normal. Avoid duplicated
          code in the production code, not in your tests :).
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>It is okay to write multiple unit-tests, but never forget to maintenance burden that will bring. Thus, even I said
      duplicated code is okay, it does not mean your code should be unmaintainable!
        <div class="note-box">
          If you are going to call your API in each test, have a dedicated function for your web client. So that if some
          breaking change happens on your API (e.g. your api path may change), then you will need to only fix 1 line. So,
          be smart &#128521;
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Since we focus on specific small units, you should <strong>mock</strong> anything else beside your target.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unit-tests are available inside your project, so you won't be able to test your end product image (i.e. Docker
        image). Or, alternatively you won't be able to test whether your configmap of kubernetes deployment is really respected
        by the application or not.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="ct-testing">What are Component Tests?<a class="anchor-link" href="#ct-testing" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>
    The second level of tests can be <span style="color:#4db8ff">component tests</span>.
    Component tests' scope is a single service itself not just a function
    of the application like unit tests. Thus, you actually need to deploy your service. However, mock everything outside
    of your service.
    <div class="note-box">
      üëâ Let's say you have a microservice A which interacts with microservice B, and if you want to write a component
    test for microservice A. Just deploy microservice A, and mock any expected response from microservice B.
    </div>
  </p>

  <h2 id="system-testing">What are System (Integration) Tests?<a class="anchor-link" href="#system-testing" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>
    The third level and the one with the most coverage is <span style="color:#4db8ff">system (integration) tests</span>.
    In these tests, you need to deploy  your product as a whole.
    i.e. Deploy all microservices, deploy any Identity and Access Management (IAM) component.
    The idea of integration tests are to test <strong>business cases</strong>. Show interactions across different services,
    and prove that you achieved expected results for your features.
    <div class="note-box">
      üëâ Let's say you were implementing a feature about "adding users".
      Your tests may show:
      <ul>
        <li>You are able to add user from microservice A's API</li>
        <li>You are able to retrieve user from microservice B's API</li>
      </ul>
    But, do not try to cover all edge cases of "retrieving user API of microservice B" from system-tests. You should cover
    edge cases in your unit-tests and component-tests. Integration tests should show that interactions between different
    services work as expected, <strong>not</strong> a single service's feature works as expected.
    </div>
  </p>
  <h2 id="load-testing">What are Load Tests?<a class="anchor-link" href="#load-testing" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      <span style="color:#4db8ff">Load tests</span> are used to check <strong>performance</strong> of the whole system under some expected load.
      Thus, you need to deploy everything in your product similar to integration tests.
    <div class="note-box">
      üëâ Let's say you expect around 10k users to call one of your APIs at the same time. Then, you need to call your API
    10k times simultaneously, and note down your performance metrics such as response times, http codes, resource usages.
    </div>
    <div class="note-box">
      If you go further than your expected users load to the point of breaking your system, load tests become something called
      <span style="color:#4db8ff">stress testing</span>. In this case, the idea is to observe what happens when your system breakdowns, and how it recovers.
    </div>
    </p>

  <h2 id="fuzzy-testing">What are Fuzz (Fuzzy) Tests?<a class="anchor-link" href="#fuzz-testing" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Although I did not write a fuzz test in my work environment, I worked with it during one of my master course. Thus, I
      can talk about it üòÜ
      Fuzzy testing is all about bombarding your system with unexpected, weird, broken, random inputs. The overall idea
      is to see behavior of your application under unexpected inputs.
    <div class="note-box">
      An application should not crash, freeze or shout out different exceptions under weird inputs from user.
      Example input of such fuzz test can be: <strong>@@*?@###\x00\xFF</strong>
    </div>
    Fuzz tests usually use specific program to create large volumes of these weird inputs.
    Then, these tools record behavior of your application, alongside with their memory states to ensure there is no memory leaks too.
    </p>

  <div class="warning-box">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Note:</strong> I know that there are more different testing techniques than these above ones. However, I did not need
    to touch other techniques as a backend developer, so I don't have experiences on them. That's why I did not talk about
    them. You can just google "software testing techniques", and see numerous techniques üò§
  </div>

  <h2 id="practices">Some Personal Real Life Practices<a class="anchor-link" href="#practices" aria-label="Link to this section">üîó</a></h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing tests are as much important as implementing your feature!</li>
    <li>Run regular load tests. You may introduce some memory leaks accidentally while doing small updates on your code.
    You can easily catch these with regular load test.</li>
    <li>Try to make your system (integration) tests <strong>documentable</strong> in a way that you can share with non-developers to showcase your feature's capabilities.</li>
    <li>Proper usage of mocking is important!</li>
    <li>Although system tests' scope corresponds to full system deployment, this may not be possible always, or
    can be expensive approach. Thus, you can focus on more fine granulated way for your system. For instance, you may skip
    deploying some applications if you think they are not directly interacting with your group of application although you deliver
    them in your product.</li>
    <li>One good way to review other developer's merge requests is checking their tests as a first step without looking their main code.
      Thus, you can have an idea about what they are trying to achieve in their code, and which edge cases they think they covered.</li>
    <li>Testing your configuration parameters are respected by your application is really important! For example, you may
    have an configuration flag which enable user to use database connections with TLS. You may think that you implemented
    everything correctly for it, but if your application does not follow your simple true/false flag, anything go wrong!
    This is especially a problem for cloud deployable application where there can be multi step configuration passing into application
    such s-as kubernetes configmaps/secrets, default configuration values and so on.</li>
    <li>You can go even further and check <span style="color:#4db8ff">Test Driven Development (TDD)</span> in detail.</li>
